## Welcome to Ruthless Physics

Welcome to Ruthless Physics. I have tried on and off to start a blog about astrophysics and I am hoping this is here to stay.

## Why Ruthless Physics?

The name "Ruthless" originates from my Grandma, Ruth. She has always been a big supporter and is always curious to learn more, much like myself. 

## What is Ruthless Physics?

The aim of this blog is to make astrophysics accessible. We are but a tiny speck floating in a vast ocean of space. In that ocean of space lies black holes, supernova, neutron stars and much more. I hope to be your guide as we navigate through the wonders of the universe. 


## About the Author

Hi! I'm Ollie. I studied Physics at uni and am in the process of completing my research masters (MPhil) in Astrophysics. My research at the time of publishing is on galaxy evolution. I look at how Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) behave and how they influence the life of galaxies. Outside of my research, I attempt to inspire students and get them excited about astrophysics through outreach events. This blog is an extension of my outreach work, where I hope to inspire you about what is beyond our home here on Earth. I also hope to teach you about the scientific process and explain how we know what we know.

I hope you enjoy this blog!
