      <description>Welcome to Ruthless Physics Welcome to Ruthless Physics. I have tried on and off to start a blog about astrophysics and I am hoping this is here to stay.
Why Ruthless Physics? The name &amp;ldquo;Ruthless&amp;rdquo; originates from my Grandma, Ruth. She has always been a big supporter and is always curious to learn more, much like myself.
What is Ruthless Physics? The aim of this blog is to make astrophysics accessible.</description>
